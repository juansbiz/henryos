# Orchestration — juansbiz LLC

## Active Master Plan: 1-Month Sprint (Feb 17 → Mar 17, 2026)

**Revenue Doctrine:** Every agent-hour that doesn't make money faster is wasted.

### The Cascade
```
Juan (CEO) → Henry (COO) → Dep Heads (Warren/Hormozi/Elon) → MUSCLE Agents
```

### Current Priority Stack
1. **InboxEQ** — Revenue priority #1. Ship by Feb 20. Sell via LinkedIn/X outbound.
2. **Axolop Self-Hosted MVP** — Ship by Feb 23. Docker one-command install. Cloud in March.
3. **Axolop B2B** — Juan's personal variant. Forms, Calendar, Community, Email. Feature-flagged.

### ICP (Portfolio-Wide)
- **ICP 1:** Ecom brands doing $10K+/mo — both InboxEQ and Axolop serve them
- **ICP 2:** Aspiring ecom entrepreneurs — $1 community → Axolop free → grow into paying customers

### Cross-Business Funnel
```
Aspiring founders → $1 Community → Axolop free self-hosted → Axolop Cloud
Established brands → InboxEQ → Axolop (50% off cross-sell)
```
